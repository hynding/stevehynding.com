# Channeling John Swartzwelder

Growing up, I obsessed over The Simpsons. To be honest, I sort of still do. 
I don't believe there's an episode I haven't seen unless it been recently recorded on my DVR.

John Swartzwelder wrote most of the best episodes, almost entirely by himself 
(including "Homer the Great" - the one where Homer joins the ancient secret society of the Stonecutters). 
His episodes are my muse - they play regularly as my selected background noise 
to channel when trying to write something funny, clever and so painfully straight-forward you 
feel silly laughing so hard.
