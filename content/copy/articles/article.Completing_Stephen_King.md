Notes
* I intend to re-read "Misery" on my own; it will be after I get through the 20th century works.
* Stories with incomplete dates are inaccurate. In fact, only "The Green Mile" is accurate to the day. The rest are approximations, and only the most recent are accurate to within 90 days.
* Both Pet Semetary and Gerald's Game were attempted in my teenage years. My mother had copies of both but I never got through more than 20 pages.
* After "The Dark Half", I got on a Shane Stevens kick (Dead City, By Reason of Insanity, The Anvil Chorus), thanks to the King himself.
