Tomorrow is my 38th birthday. 

I have been mentally preparing myself for this birthday as the dawn to the age 
where I will make many strides in meeting (and making) my lifetime goals.

1. ORGANIZE YOUR LIFE
    a. Clean! I must keep everything clean after making a mess. This includes 
        cleaning code during TDD, 
        cleaning the kitchen or bedroom immediately after using it, 
        cleaning my wallet every night by filing receipts
        cleaning the counter by filing (or addressing) bills
    b. Schedule! I must maintain a system to plan my activities ahead of time
    c. Archive! I must intuitively tag, scan, remark, track data pertaining to activities
    d. Economize! Track allowances for special purposes, make better/immediate use of data from receipts
    e. Write! Write about the day, what I read, play, watch, did; plan on fiction when ready
    f. Sell everything I haven't used in a year (GAMES!) 
        i. Make a spreadsheet of all games (to sell, initially)
        ii. Sign-up for free month of Amazon seller account
        iii. List all games for sale
        iV. Make blog post of games, post to FaceBook
