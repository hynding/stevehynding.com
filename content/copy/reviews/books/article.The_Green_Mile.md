I saw the movie over 15 years before I read the book. The movie was fantastic and followed the book in every was I could remember.

Percy Whetmore is one of King's most evil creations; all the more chilling he's 100% unpossessed human.

The ending was the most distracting and unnecessary part: we don't need to know how Paul Edgecomb's wife dies in glorified detail.
