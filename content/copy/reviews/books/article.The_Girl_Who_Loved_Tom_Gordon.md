# The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon
by Stephen King

A girl loses her way in the woods while on a day hike with her (divorced) mother and older brother.
An unusually short novel for Mr. King (224p), it sets the scene quickly and effectively drawing us into the mind, 
desires and (of course) fears  of a level-headed, baseball-loving, preteen girl.
